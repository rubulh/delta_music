<p>
   Until recently, I only had the vaguest of ideas of what mod_rewrite was, and I certainly
   had no clue about how to use it.  So, when I started designing this site, I decided to 
   delve into the wonders that are the mod_rewrite Apache module.
</p>

<h3>So, what is mod_rewrite for?</h3>

<p>
   Simply, mod_rewrite is used for rewriting a URL at the server level, giving the user 
   output for that final page.  So, for example, a user may ask for 
   <code>http://www.somesite.com/widgets/blue/</code>, but will really be given 
   <code>http://www.somesite.com/widgets.php?colour=blue</code> by the server.  Of course, the
   user will be none the wiser to this little bit of chicanery.
</p>

<p>
   On <a href="http://www.workingwith.me.uk/">workingwith.me.uk</a>, 
   <a href="http://www.workingwith.me.uk/blog/31743/">I use mod_rewrite to 
   redirect all pages to one central PHP page</a>, which then loads the data that the user wanted 
   from an external data file.  Lots of people use mod_rewrite to show an “alternative” image
   when people are hotlinking directly to their images.
</p>
                                <h3>What do I need to get mod_rewrite working?</h3>

<p>
   There’s pretty much only one thing you’ll need to get mod_rewrite working for you,
   and that’s to have the mod_rewrite module installed on your Apache server!  
</p>
<p>
   For the
   purpose of this article, I’m going to assume that you don’t have access to view or edit 
   the Apache server httpd.conf file, so the easiest way to check whether the mod_rewrite
   module is installed will be to look on your phpinfo page.  If you’ve not already created
   one of these for yourself, just copy and paste the following code into an new text file 
   using your favourite text editor, save it as <code>phpinfo.php</code>, and upload it to 
   your server:
</p>

<pre>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</pre>

<p>
   Load that page up in your web browser, and perform a search for “mod_rewrite”.  All being well,
   you’ll find it in the “Apache loaded modules” section of the page.  If it isn’t there,
   you’ll have to contact your hosting company and politely ask them to add it to the Apache
   configuration.
</p>

<p>
   Assuming the mod_rewrite module is loaded, then you’re good to go!
</p>

<h3>A simple mod_rewrite example</h3>

<p>
   So, let’s write a simple mod_rewrite example.  This isn’t going to be anything fancy; we’re
   just going to redirect people who ask for <code>alice.html</code> to the page 
   <code>bob.html</code> instead.  First, let’s create the Alice and Bob pages.  Below is
   Alice’s webpage - create a similar one for Bob.

</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Alice's webpage&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         This is Alice's webpage
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>
  Upload both of these to your web server, and check that you can view both of them.  Now
  comes the fun - we’re going to add a couple of lines to your .htaccess file.
  The .htaccess file is a text file which contains Apache directives.  Any directives which
  you place in it will apply to the directory which the .htaccess file sits in, and any
  below it.  To ours, we’re going to add the following:

</p>

<pre>RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^alice.html$ bob.html</pre>

<p>
   Upload this .htaccess file to the same directory as alice.html and bob.html, and reload
   Alice’s page.  You should see Bob’s page being displayed, but Alice’s URL.  If you still see 
   Alice’s page being displayed, then check you’ve followed the instructions correctly (you 
   may have to clear your cache).  If things still aren’t working for you, then contact your 
   technical support people and ask them to enable mod_rewrite and the FileInfo override in 
   their httpd.conf file for you
</p>

<h3>The structure of a RewriteRule</h3>

<pre>RewriteRule <i>Pattern Substitution [OptionalFlags]</i></pre>

<p>
   The general structure of a RewriteRule is fairly simple if you already understand
   regular expressions.  This article isn’t intended to be a tutorial about regular
   expressions though - there are already plenty of those available.  RewriteRules are
   broken up as follows:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>RewriteRule</dt>
	<dd>
	   <p>
         This is just the name of the command.
	   </p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Pattern</dt>
	<dd>
	   <p>
         A regular expression which will be applied to the “current” URL.  If any RewriteRules
         have already been performed on the requested URL, then that changed URL will be the
         current URL.
	   </p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Substitution</dt>

	<dd>
	   <p>
         Substitution occurs in the same way as it does in Perl, PHP, etc.
	   </p>
	   <p>
	      You can include backreferences and server variable names (<code>%{VARNAME}</code>) 
	      in the substitution.  Backreferences to this RewriteRule should be written as
	      <code>$N</code>, whereas backreferences to the previous RewriteCond should be written
	      as <code>%N</code>.
	   </p>

	   
	   <p>
	      A special substitution is <code>-</code>.  This substitution tells Apache to not
	      perform any substitution.  I personally find that this is useful when using the
	      <code>F</code> or <code>G</code> flags (see below), but there are other uses as well.
	   </p>
	</dd>

	<dt>OptionalFlags</dt>

	<dd>
	   <p>
         This is the only part of the RewriteRule which isn’t mandatory.  Any flags which you
         use should be surrounded in square brackets, and comma separated.  The flags which
         I find to be most useful are: 
	   </p>
	   
	   <ul>
	      <li>
	         <p>
	            <code>F</code> - 
	            Forbidden.  The user will receive a 403 error.
	         </p>

	      </li>
	      <li>
	         <p>
	            <code>L</code> - 
	            Last Rule.  No more rules will be proccessed if this one was successful.
	         </p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
	         <p>

	            <code>R[=code]</code> - 
	            Redirect.  The user’s web browser will be visibly redirected to the substituted
	            URL.  If you use this flag, you <em>must</em> prefix the substitution with
	            <code>http://www.somesite.com/</code>, thus making it into a true URL.  If no
	            code is given, then a HTTP reponse of 302 (temporarily moved) is sent.
	         </p>
	      </li>
	   </ul>
	   
	   <p>
	      A full list of flags is given in the Apache mod_rewrite manual.
	   </p>

	</dd>

</dl>

<h3>A slightly more complicated mod_rewrite example</h3>

<p>
  Let’s try a slightly more meaty example now.  Suppose you have a web page which takes
  a parameter.  This parameter tells the page how to be displayed, and what content to pull
  into it.  Humans don’t tend to like remembering the additional syntax of query strings for
  URLs, and neither do search engines.  Both sets of people seem to much prefer a straight
  URL, with no extra bits tacked onto the end.
</p>
<p>
   In our example, you’ve created a main index page with takes a <code>page</code> parameter.
   So, a link like <code>index.php?page=software</code> would take you to a software page,
   while a link to <code>index.php?page=interests</code> would take you to an interests page.
   What we’ll do with mod_rewrite is to silently redirect users from 
   <code>page/software/</code> to <code>index.php?page=software</code> etc.   

</p>

<p>
   The following is what needs to go into your .htaccess file to accomplish that:
</p>

<pre>RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^page/([^/\.]+)/?$ index.php?page=$1 [L]</pre>

<p>
   Let’s walk through that RewriteRule, and work out exactly what’s going on:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>^page/</dt>

	<dd>
	   <p>
	      Sees whether the requested page starts with <code>page/</code>.  If it doesn’t,
	      this rule will be ignored.
	   </p>
	</dd>
	<dt>([^/.]+)</dt>
	<dd>
	   <p>

	      Here, the enclosing brackets signify that anything that is matched will be
	      remembered by the RewriteRule.  Inside the brackets, it says “I’d like one or
	      more characters that aren’t a forward slash or a period, please”.   Whatever is found
	      here will be captured and remembered.
	   </p>
	</dd>
	<dt>/?$</dt>
	<dd>
	   <p>
	      Makes sure that the only thing that is found after what was just matched is a
	      possible forward slash, and nothing else.  If anything else is found, then this
	      RewriteRule will be ignored.
	   </p>
	</dd>

	<dt>index.php?page=$1</dt>
	<dd>
	   <p>
	      The actual page which will be loaded by Apache.  <code>$1</code> is magically
	      replaced with the text which was captured previously.  
	   </p>
	</dd>

	<dt>[L]</dt>
	<dd>
	   <p>
	      Tells Apache to not process any more RewriteRules if this one was successful.
	   </p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>
   Let’s write a quick page to test that this is working.  The following test script will simply
   echo the name of the page you asked for to the screen, so that you can check that the 
   RewriteRule is working.

</p>
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Second mod_rewrite example&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         The requested page was:
         &lt;?php echo $_GET['page']; ?&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>
   Again, upload both the index.php page, and the .htaccess file to the same directory. 
   Then, test it!  If you put the page in <code>http://www.somesite.com/mime_test/</code>,
   then try requesting <code>http://www.somesite.com/mime_test/page/software</code>.  The
   URL in your browser window will show the name of the page which you requested, but the
   content of the page will be created by the <code>index.php</code> script!  This technique
   can obviously be extended to pass multiple query strings to a page - all you’re limited
   by is your imagination.

</p>

<h3>Conditional Statements and mod_rewrite</h3>

<p>
   But what happens when you start getting people hotlinking to your images (or other files)?
   Hot linking is the act of including an image, media file, etc from someone else’s server
   in one of your own pages as if it were your own.  Obviously, as a webmaster, there are
   plenty of times when you don’t want people doing that.  You’ll almost certainly have seen examples
   where someone has linked to one image on a website, only for a completely different, 
   “nasty” one to be shown instead.  So, how is this done?
</p>

<p>
   It’s pretty simple really.  All it takes are a couple of RewriteCond statements in your
   .htaccess file.
</p>

<p>
   RewriteCond statements are as they sound - conditional statements for RewriteRules.
   The basic format for a RewriteCond is <code>RewriteCond test_string cond_pattern</code>.
   For our purpose, we will set the test_string to be the HTTP_REFERER.  If the test string
   is neither empty nor our own server, then we will serve an alternative (low bandwidth)
   image, which tells the person who is hotlinking off for stealing our bandwidth.

</p>

<p>
   Here’s how we do that:
</p>

<pre>RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(www\.)?somesite.com/.*$ [NC]
RewriteRule \.(gif|jpg|png)$ http://www.somesite.com/nasty.gif [R,L]</pre>

<p>
   Here, the RewriteRule will only be performed if all the preceeding RewriteConds are
   fulfilled.  In the second RewriteCond, <code>[NC]</code> simply means “No Case”, so it
   doesn’t matter whether the domain name was written in upper case, lower case or a mixture
   of the two.  So, any requests for gif, jpg or png files from referers other than somesite.com
   will result in your “nasty” image being shown instead.  
</p>

<p>
   The <code>[R,L]</code> in
   the RewriteRule simply means “Redirect, Last”.  So, the RewriteRule will visibly redirect 
   output to “nasty.gif” and no more RewriteRules will be performed on this URL.
</p>
<p>
   If you simply don’t want the hot linkers to see any image at all when they hot link to your
   images, then simply change the final line to 
   <code>RewriteRule \.(gif|jpg|png)$ - [F]</code>.  The <code>-</code> means “don’t rewrite 
   the requested URL”, and the <code>[F]</code> means “Forbidden”.  So, the hot linker will 
   get a “403 Forbidden message”, and you don’t end up wasting your bandwidth.

</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
  mod_rewrite is an incredibly handy tool to have in your arsenal.  This article only
  scratched the surface of what is possible with mod_rewrite, but should have given you
  enough information to go out and start mod_rewriting history yourself!

									<p>This is an excellent article. The rewriting of <a href="http://www.site.com/content" rel="nofollow">http://www.site.com/content</a> to <a href="http://www.site.com/?id=content" rel="nofollow">http://www.site.com/?id=content</a> is the most interesting one to me, although I’m curious how one would rewrite <a href="http://www.site.com/content/edit" rel="nofollow">http://www.site.com/content/edit</a> to something like <a href="http://www.site.com/?id=content&action=edit." rel="nofollow">http://www.site.com/?id=content&amp;action=edit.</a> Now THAT would be excellent!</p>

									<p>A most excellent article, many thanks.
Unfortunately, I fell over it just as I had solved my problem :(
Am appending the problem and the solution in case it’s useful:</p>

<p>Problem: how to determine which language to use when serving files,
and then make it look to the user as if the files are being served out
of a language-specific directory (trying to be helpful)
Content negotiation wasn’t the answer, as the content is dbase driven.
So I wanted to append a query string to all urls, but have it be invisible to users.</p>

<p>Solution:
if ( mysite.com/ is requested )
then serve up mysite.com/index.html
and determine user’s preferred language from the browser.
if lang. preference not set, default to english
and set $lang=’en’</p>

<p>then parse all docs thusly:</p>

<pre><code># rewrite all requests for language-specific files
RewriteEngine on
Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteRule ^en/(.*)$ $1?lang=en [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^de/(.*)$ $1?lang=de [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^fr/(.*)$ $1?lang=fr [NC,L]</code></pre>

<p>so eg. all requests for german files look like this:
<a href="http://mysite.com/de/valley/page.html" rel="nofollow">http://mysite.com/de/valley/page.html</a>
and bookmarked links automatically come up with the correct language.
Look Ma, no cookies!</p>

<p>By the way, if you know of a better solution, please don’t hesitate to tell me.</p>

									<p>Yes, also you might want to use the link tag to specify other language versions as a schematic thing. Like it says near the bottom of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html</a></p>

									<p>There is a massive bug in mod<em>rewrite in current Apache releases: mod</em>rewrite strips one level of URL encoding between matched strings and output values. If your incoming URL happens to contain URL encoded values, it will thus generate invalid URLs. for example:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^something/(.*) something.php?var=$1</code></pre>

<p>If you pass in a URL like</p>

<pre><code>something/hello%20world</code></pre>

<p>It will be rewritten as:</p>

<pre><code>something.php?var=hello world</code></pre>

<p>which is not a valid URL.</p>

<p>It happens that this is bearable for many cases (also why it has not been fixed), as URL encoding does not affect many string values, but if you’re doing anything like passing entire URLs as parameters (e.g. for a redirector), this can cause major problems. This problem has nothing to do with the [NE] option, which is concerned with allowing URL encoded values in the rewrite rule itself, not the string it is applied to.</p>

									<p>I have had a go at solving the problem below.</p>

<pre><code>/pictures/index.php?path=&amp;img=test.jpg
/pictures/index.php?path=prague&amp;img=DSC01062.JPG</code></pre>

<p>The idea being that the url becomes /pictures/test</p>

<p>The only thing with this is that I am not that great at finding the solution.
Also, Blorp in creating url direct from the directory and file structure so /pictures/prague/DSC01062.JPG really is a url also. I could use /pictures/prague/DSC01062 without the .JPG file extension but have found that this is a bit hard.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
#RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /pictures/
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^alice.html$ bob.html
#RewriteRule ^page/([^/\.]+)/?$ index.php?page=$1 [L]
#/pictures/index.php?path=&amp;img=test.jpg
#/pictures/index.php?path=prague&amp;img=DSC01062.JPG
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([^\.\?/]+)/([0-9]+)$ /pictures/index.php?path=$1&amp;img=$2 [QSA]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([^\.\?/]+)/([A-Za-z_0-9\-]+)$ /pictures/index.php?path=$1&amp;img=$2 [QSA]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([^\.\?/]+)/$ /pictures/$1 [R]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([^\.\?/]+)$ /pictures/index.php?path=$1 [QSA]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></pre>

									<p>Rajan,</p>

<p>I would have thought this would be something you can do in the language you’re using. In PHP, I assign the login status to a variable which is included with every page. If the user hits a page requiring login, it’s something like:</p>

<pre><code>if ($login==0) {
  # Not logged in, redirect
  header('location: otherpage.php');
  die;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that because I’ve used the header command and therefore am modifying the HTTP headers, this must go before any output to the browser.</p>

<p>Hope this helps…</p>

									<p>Great tutorial.  I’m just learning about Mod_Rewrites. Unfortunately, I’m still having problems including a query string in my redirect.  I’m trying to do the following but need some help:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.example.com/index.php?pageId=0&start=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/index.php?pageId=0&amp;start=0</a></p>

<p>needs to redirect to:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.example.com/index.php?pageId=117&start=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/index.php?pageId=117&amp;start=0</a></p>

<p>This is what I tried in my .htaccess dir, but it’s not doing anything:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^gallery/index.php?pageId=0&amp;start=0 gallery/index.php?pageId=117&amp;start=0 [L]

									<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Sorry it’s taken me a while to reply to you, and I hope you’ve managed to find the solution to your problem elsewhere by now!</p>

<p>Just in case you haven’t though, here we go.  I’ve not actually checked that this works, but even if it doesn’t it should give you somewhere to go from:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^pageId=0&amp;start=0$
RewriteRule ^gallery/index.php gallery/index.php?pageId=117&amp;start=0
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the query string is not part of the URL that the RewriteRule looks at, so you have to check this in a RewriteCond beforehand. Basically, the rule above says “Is the query string for this URL ‘pageId=0&amp;start=0’?  It is?  Excellent!  Now, does the URL I’ve been given start with ‘gallery/index.php’?  It does?  Fantastic!  Lets rewrite the user to ‘gallery/index.php?pageId=117&amp;start=0’.”</p>

<p>One thing to note is that if you were wanting to redirect the user to a different URL with the same query string, then you could use the QSA (query string append) flag on the end of the rule to tack the original query string onto the redirected URL. </p>

									<p>First off all a real COOL article Neil, the knowledge provide in it is more than enough to make some good things if anyone is realy interested.</p>

<p>I have a few question though, if possible could you please guide us on to them:</p>

Case 1

<p>www.abc.com/index.php?s=mobiles
can easy be converted to 
www.abc.com/mobiles.htm
* It works good fine and preety easy to do that.</p>

Case 2 ????????

<p>www.abc.com/index.php?s=mobiles phones
www.abc.com/index.php?s=mobiles%20phones</p>

<p>How can these be converted to 
www.abc.com/mobiles_phones.htm ????</p>

<p>Well i am a bit ok with regex, definately not expert nor good but also not dumb, can use them when i want them too. :)</p>

<p>how will replace from ” ” to “<em>” take over here ?
We do not have preg</em>replace or anything like that….</p>

<p>Also will using mod_rewrite damage us at the SE side. I mean will google treat them as normal html files.</p>

<p>Awaiting for your valued reply.</p>

									<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>Really good article that has explained this subject really well but please may I ask if the following is possible? I cannot work it out. </p>

<p>I have a site tha is written in PHP and pulls data from a MySql DB. The site utilises query strings and I would like to map the query generated pages to the more search engine friendly page titles. For example I would like to acheive to the following mappings:</p>

<p>content.php?id=1 to map to /aboutus
content.php?id=2 to map to /contactus
content.php?id=3 to map to /newfiles</p>

<p>There are about 80 odd pages on the site and would like to know if I would need to map each link as there are all in the format ?id=x or is there a more elegant way to approach this?</p>

									<p>Wow, this is an excellent tutorial both for the noobs and for the more advanced webdevs.</p>

<p>Here’s a little tutorial to people who have no idea how to use mod_rewrite:</p>

<p>If your site consists of only a few pages and you’ve seen the fancy url’s like domain.com/contact rather than domain.com/contact.html you can just use:</p>

<p>RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^contact$ /contact.html [L]</p>

<p>And if you want to hide the filename from being guessed, rename it to con1.html, than you’ll have</p>

<p>RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^contact$ /con1.html [L]</p>

<p>Play around with the forward slashes (/) since one webserver may differ from the other.</p>

									<p>Hi,</p>

<p>thanks for the well written article, it “may” have solved my probs for me. As you are well aware there is a huge problem with web application security, in particular flash/php, i have been looking for a solution to be able to invisibly pass something unique to flash from the server thus identifying to all php files that its a legitimate request. With this i think it might stump most hackers as they will never actually manage to find out where they are so i can use the secretly hidden url as a first step security measure and create a dummy index.html with a dummy php code passed to the flash which will never work.</p>

<p>Do i have any holes in this argument that you can see?</p>

									<p>Great article - love the simplicity you start off with!</p>

<p>I want to know if I can use mod_rewrite to test a new host  with root relative links, before the domain is resolved to the new host.  The temp domain is www.servername.com/~mysite.  My images and scripts of course don’t work, so I cannot test.  Can I rewrite the document (web) root?  I tried the example in Apache’s URL rewriting guide: (Moved Document Root)</p>

<p>RewriteRule   ^/$  /e/www/  [R]</p>

<p>This has no effect when I try it locally, so maybe I’m missing something.  (BTW, your simple example at the top does work).  This must have a very simple answer, I’m just new at it!  Thank you to anyone who can point me in the right direction!</p>

									<p>U r article helped me a lot about using mod<em>rewrite.
Thanks for contributing u r knowledge with all.
But i am having one question —-
Is this true that when we use mod</em>rewrite then all the paths to external css files and javascript files are removed from the result page.</p>

<p>Becoz when i used the code the final page(result page) has no css rules applied to it and the page is getting totally destorted.</p>

<p>Help me in this problem.Suggest me the solution for the same.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot,
Abhimanyu</p>

									<p>Contents provided here on mod rewrite are great. I too was looking for a way to convert dynamic php pages into static html pages by using mod rewrite command in .ht access file in root.</p>
